Growl4Rails
==============
 
Growl4Rails is a javascript component that provides the UI for growl-like notifications in your rails application.

This plugin requires Prototype 1.6 or higher and Scriptaculous 1.7 or higher.

Installation
===============

If you are on Rails 2.1 or higher:

$ script/plugin install git://github.com/jfiorato/growl4rails.git

For older versions of Rails, cd into your application's vendor/plugins, and execute the following:

$ git clone --depth 1 git://github.com/jfiorato/growl4rails.git
$ mkdir ../../public/javascripts/growl4rails ../../public/stylesheets/growl4rails ../../public/images/growl4rails
$ cp growl4rails/public/javascripts/* ../../public/javascripts/growl4rails/
$ cp growl4rails/public/stylesheets/* ../../public/stylesheets/growl4rails/
$ cp growl4rails/public/images/* ../../public/images/growl4rails/
 
Usage
=====

In your view put the following:

<%= growl4rails_includes %>

This will set the default growl duration to 5000 milliseconds and the default max number of growls to show to 3.

If you'd like a different default duration and max number to show do the following:
<%= growl4rails_includes(3000, 5) %>

The arguments to this method are:
duration = The amount of time the growl window shows.
max_showing = The maximum number of growls to show at one time.


Then when you'd like the Growl window to appear:

<script type="text/javascript" language="javascript">
  Growl.show({image_path:"/images/download.png", title:"Foo Bar.pdf", message:"File is ready for download.");
</script>

Growl.show method takes a single hash as an argument.  The hash can have the following keys:

image_path - 32x32 icon
title - title of the growl
message - the growl message

To handle the 'click' event from the Growl, you can do the following:

<script type="text/javascript" language="javascript">
  var growl_id = Growl.show({image_path:"/images/download.png", title:"Foo Bar.pdf", message:"File is ready for download.");
  
  document.observe(growl_id + ':clicked', function(event) {
    console.log('Growl %s was clicked.', Event.findElement(event).id);
  });
  
</script>
